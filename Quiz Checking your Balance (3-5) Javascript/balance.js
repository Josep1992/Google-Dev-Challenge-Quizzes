// Use the following variables in your solution:

// balance - the account balance
// isActive - if account is active
// checkBalance - if you want to check balance
// Hint: The variable balance could be a value less than, greater than, or equal to 0. The variables isActive and checkBalance are booleans that can be set to true or false.

// TIP: To print out the account balance with decimal points (i.e. 325.00), use the .toFixed() method and pass it the number of decimal points you want to use. For example, balance.toFixed(2) returns 325.00.

// TIP: Make sure to test your code with different values. For example,

// If checkBalance equals true and isActive equals false, then Your account is no longer active. should be printed to the console.

// change the values of `balance`, `checkBalance`, and `isActive` to test your code
var balance = 325.00;
var checkBalance = true;
var isActive = false;
