			<p>An orca is a marine mammal. Did you know that orcas are actually dolphins? In fact, they are the largest member of the
				dolphin family! Dolphins and whales are closely related – both are in the order Cetacea, which includes whales, dolphins,
				and porpoises. Orcas were given the name “killer whale” by ancient sailors’ observations of groups of orcas hunting and
				preying on larger whale species.</p>
