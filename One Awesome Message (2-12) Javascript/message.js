// Directions:
// Here are two awesome messages:

// "Hi, my name is Julia. I love cats. In my spare time, I like to play video games."
// "Hi, my name is James. I love baseball. In my spare time, I like to read."
// Declare and assign values to three variables for each part of the sentence that changes (firstName, interest, and hobby).

// Use your variables and string concatenation to create your own awesome message and store it in an awesomeMessage variable. Finally, print your awesome message to the JavaScript console.

/*
 * Notes:
