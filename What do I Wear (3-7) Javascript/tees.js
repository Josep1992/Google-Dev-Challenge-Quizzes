// Directions:
// Use the sizing chart above, create a series of logical expressions that prints the size of a t-shirt based on the measurements of shirtWidth, shirtLength, and shirtSleeve. Valid sizes include S, M, L, XL, 2XL, and 3XL.

// For example, if...

// var shirtWidth = 23; // size L (large)
// var shirtLength = 30; // size L (large)
// var shirtSleeve = 8.71; // size L (large)
// Then print L to the console.

// Hint: You will need to compare a range of values when checking for shirtWidth, shirtLength, and shirtSleeve. For example, if the shirt's width is at least 20", but no more than 22", then the t-shirt should be medium (M) â€” as long as the other values for the shirt's length and sleeve measurements match up.

// If shirtWidth, shirtLength, and shirtSleeve don't fit within the range of acceptable values for a specific size, then print N/A to the console. For example, if...

// var shirtWidth = 18; // size S (small)
// var shirtLength = 29; // size M (medium)
// var shirtSleeve = 8.47; // size M (medium)
// Then print N/A to the console because the measurements don't all match up with one particular size.

// TIP: Make sure to test your code with different values. For example,

// If shirtWidth equals 19, shirtLength equals 28 and shirtSleeve equals 8.21, then S should be printed to the console.
// If shirtWidth equals 26, shirtLength equals 33 and shirtSleeve equals 9.63, then 2XL should be printed to the console.
// If shirtWidth equals 18, shirtLength equals 29 and shirtSleeve equals 8.47, then N/A should be printed to the console.

// Your Code:

// change the values of `shirtWidth`, `shirtLength`, and `shirtSleeve` to test your code
